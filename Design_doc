ToDo:
-----
1) Make sure super peer accepts only one node join at a time
(super peer should return DONE on join [as per assignment document])

2) Client knows only super peer address (we shouldn't give a option of contacting peer directly)

3) We should run superpeer script from src dir. Isn't it?

4) Test cases:

5) 


Implementation details:
-----------------------
Randomly generating a key instead of using IPadress. Because, while testing in a single machine, hashing IP address is not appropriate.

Maintaining peercache(contains nodeid and its corresponding interface) at each peer, so that it minimizes Naming.lookup actions.


Assumption:
----------
1) Word and its meaning is separated with :


Command line help
-----------------

test cases:
---------
A word which exists. 
A word doesn't exists.


How to build and run:
--------------------
Follow README file.
